A histogram is a graphical representation of the frequency or percentage of data values within specified intervals in a dataset. It typically displays value intervals on the horizontal axis and the count of data values in each interval as the height of bars. For example, a histogram can illustrate the frequency of letters in a phrase like "programming massively parallel processors," where intervals are defined as ranges of four letters (e.g., "a-d," "e-h," etc.). This visualization helps identify patterns, such as concentrations or gaps in data distribution, which can be useful for detecting anomalies like credit card fraud or analyzing features in computer vision.

Histograms are widely used in various fields, including computer vision, where they help identify objects by analyzing pixel luminous values in images. They are also foundational in speech recognition, recommendation systems, and scientific data analysis. Histograms can be computed sequentially, as shown in a simple C code example, which processes input data to generate a histogram. The algorithm has a computational complexity of O(N), making it efficient for large datasets, with performance often limited by memory access speeds. Overall, histograms are a powerful tool for summarizing and analyzing data across many applications.
