Chapter 9.3 discusses two strategies for partitioning data in a buffer for parallel processing, specifically in the context of a GPU's Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) architecture and memory coalescing:

* **Strategy I: Block Partitioning:**
    * This involves dividing the buffer into contiguous blocks and assigning each block to a thread.
    * It's efficient on CPUs with a small number of threads due to good cache utilization.
    * However, on GPUs with many threads, it leads to cache interference and poor performance.
* **Strategy II: Interleaved Partitioning:**
    * This strategy addresses the memory coalescing requirement of GPUs.
    * Instead of contiguous blocks, each thread processes elements that are interleaved, separated by the elements processed by other threads.
    * This ensures that threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations, enabling coalesced memory accesses and significantly improving performance.
    * The implementation of this strategy is shown, and it is mentioned that although conceptually more complex, the code to implement it is simpler than the block partitioning implementation.
    * The chapter also explains how to calculate the stride, and how the program handles cases where the buffer size is not a multiple of the number of threads.
