This chapter section explains the challenges of parallelizing histogram computation, specifically focusing on the problem of "output interference" when multiple threads try to update the same counter.

* **The Problem: Race Conditions:**
    * When multiple threads try to increment the same counter (e.g., in a histogram), a "race condition" can occur.
    * This happens because the increment operation involves three steps: read, modify, and write.
    * If these steps from different threads interleave in certain ways, the final result can be incorrect (e.g., a counter might only be incremented once when it should have been incremented twice).

* **The Solution: Atomic Operations:**
    * Atomic operations ensure that a read-modify-write sequence is performed as a single, indivisible unit.
    * This prevents other threads from interfering with the operation, thus eliminating race conditions.
    * Atomic operations are typically implemented with hardware support to lock out other operations until the current one is complete.
    * The CUDA function `atomicAdd()` is provided as an example of how to implement an atomic addition.
* **Intrinsic functions:**
    * Intrinsic functions are special functions that are compiled directly into specific processor instructions.
