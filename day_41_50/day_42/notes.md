# Aggregated Histogram Computation
This chapter section discusses optimizing parallel histogram computation for datasets with high concentrations of identical values, which cause heavy contention and reduce throughput. The key optimization is to have each thread aggregate consecutive updates to the same histogram element into a single update.

## Key Points
**Problem**: Datasets with localized concentrations of identical values (e.g., image pixels) lead to high contention in parallel histogram computation.

**Solution**: Threads aggregate consecutive updates to the same histogram bin, reducing the number of atomic operations.

**Implementation**:
Each thread uses curr_index, prev_index, and accumulator variables.
accumulator tracks the number of aggregated updates.
prev_index tracks the index of the histogram element being aggregated.
When a new index (curr_index) is encountered, the accumulated value is atomically added to the histogram, and the aggregation starts anew.

**Trade-offs**:
Aggregation increases code complexity and overhead.
It provides significant performance gains when contention is high.
It may result in lower performance than a simple kernel when contention is low.
The provided code example demonstrates how to implement this aggregation technique in a CUDA kernel.
