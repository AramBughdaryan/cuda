# 100 Days of GPU Challenge

### Day 1
- Learned the basic syntax of C++ and CUDA.
- Implemented a kernel for increment.  
  *(Later, I added some scripts to call this kernel from PyTorch.)*
- Chapter 1 finished

### Day 2
- Implemented GPU and CPU versions of vector addition.  
  *(Unfortunately, for simple tasks like this, the GPU version turned out to be slower. )*
- Chapter 2 finished

### Day 3
- Implemented colorToGreyscaleConversion
- Read part of chapter 3. (on page 52 now... have some questions...)
