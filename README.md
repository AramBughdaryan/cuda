# 100 Days of GPU Challenge  
*(Huge thanks to [Umar Jamil](https://github.com/hkproj/100-days-of-gpu) for organizing this challenge!)*

## Progress Log

### **Day 1**
- Learned the basic syntax of C++ and CUDA.
- Implemented a simple kernel for increment.
  *(Later, I added scripts to call this kernel from PyTorch.)*
- Completed **Chapter 1**.

### **Day 2**
- Implemented both GPU and CPU versions of vector addition.
  *(Unfortunately, the GPU version was slower for this simple task.)*
- Completed **Chapter 2**.

### **Day 3**
- Implemented `colorToGreyscaleConversion`.
- Started reading **Chapter 3** (currently on page 52, with some questions).

### **Day 4**  
- Resolved questions from **Day 3**.
- Implemented an **image blurring kernel**.
- Dived into device properties section.
- Almost finished with **Chapter 3** (currently on page 64!).
- Wrote simple example how to use `image_blur.cu`.
- created helpers folder and some functions for future use.

### **Day 5** (TODO's)
- Finish the chapter 3
- Matrix Addition kernel
