### Chapter 8.7 Summary:
This chapter discusses **stream-based scan algorithms** in CUDA C programming, focusing on improving the efficiency of hierarchical scan operations by reducing memory latency and enhancing parallelism. The traditional hierarchical scan involves storing partially scanned results in global memory and reloading them in subsequent kernels, which introduces significant latency. Stream-based scan algorithms address this by allowing thread blocks to pass partial sums directly to their neighboring blocks in a domino-like fashion, reducing the need for intermediate global memory stores and loads.

Key points:
1. **Stream-Based Scan**: A single kernel performs all steps of the hierarchical scan. Thread blocks compute local scans, wait for partial sums from their left neighbors, add the received sums, and pass their results to the right neighbors.
2. **Adjacent Synchronization**: Custom synchronization between neighboring blocks ensures data is passed correctly. This is implemented using **atomic operations** and memory fences.
3. **Dynamic Block Index Assignment**: To avoid deadlocks caused by non-linear scheduling of thread blocks, dynamic block indices are assigned using a global counter and atomic operations.
4. **Performance Considerations**: Stream-based scans overlap computation and memory operations, leveraging GPU caches to minimize global memory traffic.

### Detailed Explanation of `__threadfence()` and `atomicAdd()`:

#### 1. **`__threadfence()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Ensures memory operations (writes) performed by a thread are visible to all other threads in the GPU before proceeding. It acts as a memory fence, preventing reordering of memory operations across the fence.
   - **Usage in Stream-Based Scan**:
     - After a thread block writes its partial sum to global memory, `__threadfence()` ensures the write is completed before setting a flag to notify the next block.
     - This guarantees that the next block sees the correct partial sum value when it reads from global memory.
   - **Scope**:
     - `__threadfence()` applies to all memory operations (global, shared, and local memory) within the thread.
     - It ensures consistency across the entire device, not just within a thread block.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   __threadfence(); // Ensures the partial sum is written to global memory
   atomicAdd(&flags[bid + 1], 1); // Set flag for the next block
   ```

#### 2. **`atomicAdd()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Performs an atomic addition operation on a value in global or shared memory. It ensures that no other thread can modify the value simultaneously, preventing race conditions.
   - **Usage in Stream-Based Scan**:
     - Used to implement **adjacent synchronization** by atomically updating flags or counters.
     - For example, a thread block atomically increments a global counter to assign itself a dynamic block index.
     - It also sets flags to signal the availability of partial sums to neighboring blocks.
   - **Behavior**:
     - The function reads the value at the specified memory address, adds the specified value, and writes the result back atomically.
     - It returns the original value before the addition.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   int old_value = atomicAdd(&flags[bid], 0); // Read flag atomically
   atomicAdd(&flags[bid + 1], 1); // Set flag for the next block
   ```

   - **Performance Considerations**:
     - Atomic operations are expensive but necessary for synchronization.
     - Modern GPUs optimize atomic operations using second-level caches, reducing global memory traffic.

### Key Concepts in Stream-Based Scan:
1. **Domino Effect**: Partial sums are passed sequentially between blocks, enabling a single kernel to handle all scan steps.
2. **Parallelism**: While blocks are serialized during the data-passing phase, they can execute their final phases in parallel once they receive their required sums.
3. **Deadlock Prevention**: Dynamic block index assignment ensures blocks are scheduled linearly, avoiding deadlocks caused by non-linear scheduling.
