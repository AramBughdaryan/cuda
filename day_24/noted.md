## TILED 2D CONVOLUTION WITH HALO CELLS

1. **Image Representation**: Real-world images are stored as 2D matrices in row-major layout. To optimize DRAM bandwidth utilization, images are often padded to align rows with DRAM burst boundaries. The padded format includes a "pitch" value to indicate the starting position of each row, ensuring efficient memory access.

2. **Tiled 2D Convolution**: The chapter introduces a tiled 2D convolution kernel, which is an extension of the 1D approach. The kernel processes input tiles that include "halo cells" (extra cells around the edges) to handle boundary conditions. Each thread block loads an input tile into shared memory, ensuring that only valid elements are processed, and ghost elements are set to zero.

3. **Kernel Implementation**: The kernel calculates output elements by iterating through the mask and performing multiply-accumulate operations on the input tile stored in shared memory. Threads outside the valid output range are excluded from computation. The kernel uses the pitch value to compute linearized indices for accessing image data.

4. **Performance Analysis**: The tiled 2D convolution kernel significantly reduces memory accesses compared to a basic kernel. The reduction ratio depends on the output tile size (`O_TILE_WIDTH`) and mask width (`Mask_Width`). Larger tile sizes improve performance, but require more shared memory. For example, with `Mask_Width = 5` and `O_TILE_WIDTH = 64`, the reduction ratio is 22.1, indicating a substantial decrease in memory accesses.

5. **Shared Memory Constraints**: The effectiveness of the tiled approach is limited by the available shared memory. Larger masks (e.g., `Mask_Width = 9`) require more shared memory, which may exceed the capacity of current GPUs. Future GPUs with larger shared memory could further enhance performance for applications like stencil computations.
