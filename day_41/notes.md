The chapters describe two key strategies for improving the performance of atomic operations in parallel computing:
	1.	Reducing Memory Access Latency:
	•	Atomic operations suffer when multiple threads contend for a shared variable, especially if these accesses come from DRAM with high latency.
	•	Using cache memories, particularly the last level cache, reduces this latency significantly. Modern GPUs perform atomic operations directly in the cache, which cuts access times from hundreds of cycles (for DRAM) to tens of cycles.
	•	This approach yielded major throughput improvements from the Tesla to the Fermi generation of GPUs, although for some applications the gains still fall short.
	2.	Privatization and Aggregation:
	•	Privatization:
	•	To further alleviate contention, the technique of privatization is used. It involves replicating heavily contended data (like histogram bins) into private copies that are maintained in low-latency shared memory.
	•	In the example provided (a text histogram kernel), each thread block creates its own private histogram. This enables hundreds of threads to update a shared copy in low-latency memory instead of thousands contending over a global memory copy.
	•	Aggregation:
	•	After the threads update their private copies, a merging step (aggregation) combines these local histograms back into the global one.
	•	Although merging adds some overhead, it is generally outweighed by the dramatic reduction in contention and latency during the update phase.

Overall, these techniques—leveraging fast cache memories and using privatization—work together to increase the throughput of atomic operations by reducing memory access delays and minimizing contention among threads.
